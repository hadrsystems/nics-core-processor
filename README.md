## Synopsis

The Next-Generation Incident Command System (NICS) processor services (data feed consumers, etc.)

## Dependencies
- nics-assembly
- nics-common

## Building

    mvn package


## Description

 - collabfeed-manager - *Deprecated* - Listens for new feature messages on the iweb.NICS.# topic, creates a datalayer on geoserver and maintains the status of that layer based on user changes. "Export room" functionality requests the collaboration room view layers from Geoserver. But if the layer is missing in Geoserver, it creates them first. We didn't find any usage for Incident/Collaboration room view layers created in Geoserver & KML files created on emapi generated by collabfeed-manager process. Hence we conclude that there is no need to run CollabFeedManager process.
 - component-manager-archive-builder - Used by individual modules to package up the component into a deployable tar
 - geodatafeed-consumer - Consumes AVL/PLI in the form of GML, and persists to a datafeed database which populates layers in GeoServer
 - gst2gml -
 - json-pli-consumer - Consumes AVL/PLI in the standard NICS JSON PLI format, and publishes GML to geodatafeed-consumer
 - spring-runner - Barebones example component to use as a template for writing your own consumer
 - raws-feed-processor - *Deprecated*, please use nics-synoptics-processor at https://github.com/tabordasolutions/nics-synoptics-processor
